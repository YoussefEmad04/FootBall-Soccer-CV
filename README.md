# FootBall-Soccer-CV
## This advanced football analysis project explores cutting-edge techniques in multi-object tracking, player clustering, homography, real-time pitch understanding, and the application of transformers. Using state-of-the-art models like ByteTrack and YOLOv8x-pose, combined with sophisticated embedding analysis, homography applications, and transformer models, the project provides deep insights into player movements, game strategy, and pitch dynamics. From precise pitch landmark detection to detailed spatial analysis, this project exemplifies the integration of AI, transformers, and computer vision in sports analytics, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved in understanding and visualizing football matches
